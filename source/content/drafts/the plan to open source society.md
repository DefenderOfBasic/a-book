the real prelude is open source culture. 

> we've developed a whole sub culture that knows how to build things with thousands of people's contributions (1) without it completely falling apart because anyon can add anything (2) navigating "who gets the credit" "who gets the money" this part of the book has already happened

#### (0) This is a world in which, magic is real

samzdat. it is literally real. 

ok, what about the cultural stigma of miasma theory? 

the ancient egyptian king, when civilization collapsed, and came back together? NO FLIP IT!! 


!!!!!!
imagine my dear reader! a book that writes itself. manifests itself. crazy right?

not crazy, this has already happened. 
!!!!!!!!!
#### (1) internal sense of truth / discernment

developing your own test, listening to your body, doing experiments on your mind, on your relationships. Using the process of science. Learn to fix a bike, computers, surveys. Just test things, find some truth. 

Understand map vs territory. like, REALLY understand it. Show you understand it. 

> yes!!! this is why like, when I "stopped reading advice" and decided to figure everything out for myself, my growth skyrocketed it's because I used to just follow things, be confused why it doesn't work. but now I had a way to test things myself
> 
> THEN i went back to reading advice and suddenly, holy shit, i have the best of both worlds - new ideas that come from ANYWHERE - my own internal sense of discernment to find what actually works and I built my own theories, my own body of work. and I *know* it works

#### (2) PLURALITY in science, in ways of knowing, in opinions



#### (2) everyone writing their utopia & history

it's a game of prediction. but also the many, many lenses of what history has actually happened. Spread your word. and do it well. we will teach you to market it. 

#### (3) little twitter mobs with epistemic standards / how to disagree

no one has to leave their tribe!

this idea that to find truth, we must find biased lawyers. news media SHOULD be as biased as possible. SO DO SCIENTISTS! 

‚≠ê WEAKNESSES BECAME STRENGTHS 

the best answers come from 

üìï "I come in good faith", is a book, instruction manual. And the stanford researchers love it, gets legitimacy. 

#### (4) mapping the culture sphere

like an experiment to test the speed of cultural speed. 

> imagine a meme where the goal was for it to be remade for every culture. The goal is to map connectivity of cultures and speed of transferral

> (it's like mapping out the cultural dynamics of big tech, but from 2nd hand sources, folklore-like. And seeing how much that diverges. An image of what people think the culture of Big Tech is like, vs what it is)

#### (5) Remixing art / communal ownership

we have to be able to remix art, and code, and UIs, and books

this is also to EXPLAIN art, the idea of an "art ladder"

also our twitter archives. and our ad targeting data. 

- explaining scavanger's reign 
- TOM SCOTT LATERAL GAMES

#### (6) enlightenment games?

like, "banger or not"? anonymous 

politician game 

MEDIA LITERACY GAMES FUCK YEAH

#### (7) unifying the woo woo & empirical

need biased scientists ("does writing on chaklboard work?")

"Employee of the work" mantra. No one can steal your work.

"postcards from the future" -> have everyone write this and make a book (anyone can sell this!)

"a superorganism that nourishes its parts. what is good for the whole IS good for the parts. "

the game is challenging!! it's a meta game. it's about successful prediction, of what will work, what will move people. 

‚úçÔ∏è the DMT cluster headaches. the important piece is there is always a "what is the bottleneck" piece (is it public policy? funding? tech? )

"Somewhere in the game, a big film studio joined, and it was FUCKING CRAZY WOW, but they were bad at it. because they didn't include the global collective. but that's ok. we took it, we forked it, we fixed it. it was epic. "

maybe before that ^ a company tried to make an ad, "everyone is gonna buy this", FAILED MISERBALY.. companies are FUCKING TERRIFIED of being written about in the book

üî¥ (IT GETS DARK AT ONE POINT, but it autocorrects itself. we learn we have real power). 

üí∞ the thing about giving money for no reason, and giving it back. Just a stunt. An act of faith. For the lolz. AND THEN THEY WAIVED THE FUCKING FEES MOTHERFUCKERS!!! 
- it's NOT one guy, it keeps being sent. 

there are no rules. there are NO RULES
