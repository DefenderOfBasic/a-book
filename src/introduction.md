# Where Are We Going

This is an open source "hyperstition" book about the best possible future & how we got there. 

Humanity is in a sinking ship. If we survive, it will have been because those who are competent, and those who cared found each other & coordinated. We did this by writing down our best, most realistic visions & worked to make them true.

If you find the ideas in this book brilliant, I invite you to add your name to the [list of people working on this vision](collaborators.md), and find where you are most needed. There is an enormous amount of work to do, and there is a place for everyone[^1]:

> When I wrote _There’s a Place for Everyone_ a few months ago, I got a lot of messages that were like, “Well, there’s certainly no place for me.” That breaks my heart. Look at the world! See it aching! It’s got so many problems—I promise you, there’s one with your name on it.
