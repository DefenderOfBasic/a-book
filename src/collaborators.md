# Collaborators

This is a list of people whose work I consider to be directly pulling the best possible future into existence. They are all doing work that is beneficial to themselves & the world.

- Ray (forshaper), on finding "a culture fit to feed stellar empires"
- Blair, children's books that inpire love & self actualization
- Michael, open source marketing, systems to fix consumer trust
